# DotNet Framework Version Finder

A very simple console program to report on which version of the .NET Framework is on the current computer.

Only works with .NET Framework 4.5+.

You can fork this repository to build the program yourself, or simply download and run the [DotNetFrameworkVersion.exe](https://github.com/glittle/DotNet-Framework-Finder/blob/master/DotNetFrameworkVersion.exe?raw=true) file.
